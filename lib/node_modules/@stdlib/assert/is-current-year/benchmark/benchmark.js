Now I am in the process of making a small website that I would like to host online. I have a bunch of these benchmarks, and I am wondering whether I can benchmark them online as well. I'm not sure if this is possible. I have made some research on the internet but I did not find any information about this.
So I have 2 questions:

Is it possible to benchmark JavaScript on a website? If so, how?
If not, how can I benchmark JavaScript on a website?



A:

You can use benchmark.js to benchmark your code.
I have used benchmark.js in a website before and it worked.
Here is a link to their documentation.
