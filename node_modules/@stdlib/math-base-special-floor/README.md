    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Round a double-precision floating-point number toward negative infinity.

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/math-base-special-floor
```

</section>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var floor = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-floor' );
```

#### floor( x )

Rounds a double-precision floating-point number toward negative infinity.

```javascript
var v = floor( -4.2 );
// returns -5.0

v = floor( 9.99999 );
// returns 9.0

v = floor( 0.0 );
// returns 0.0

v = floor( NaN );
// returns NaN
```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random-base-randu' );
var floor = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-floor' );

var x;
var i;

for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    x = (randu()*100.0) - 50.0;
    console.log( 'floor(%d) = %d', x, floor( x ) );
